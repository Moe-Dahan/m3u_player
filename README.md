# m3u_player
A Basic M3U Player Download or select M3U file and enjoy, Its not the best looking but it works requires VLC player to be installed

UPDATE: I added grabing the m3u from URL A Little bit GUI Updates It Now Renders the VLC Window inside same GUI I Still Need to Work on the stop Button and some 
tweaks to Perfect it as of e.g now you still need to press the red stop button before you can change channels.
